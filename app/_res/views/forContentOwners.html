<h2>For Content Owners</h2>

<p>At heart we’re music lovers and record collectors first. DJing and this podcast grew out of that love. We just wanted to share our favorite music and maybe give a tiny bit of exposure to musicians who might otherwise be forgotten. We’re not a for profit operation and we don’t make any money from our podcast or this website. It’s our hope that if a listener hear’s something they like, they’ll buy the record, CD or some type of legitimate download. Even though our intentions are pure we realize that some content owners desire a greater degree of control. If, for whatever reason, you would like us to remove material for which you own the copyright, <a ui-sref="contact">drop us a line</a> and we’ll remove it and make a note not to use material from that artist in the future.</p>
