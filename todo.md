1. deep link redirects of wp urls: I don't think I actually need that property in the JSON to do this. I think I can just parse the episode number from the old path and use that as the key to redirect to the correct route.
2. page animations: slide left or right depending on nav direction
3. logo animation: random placement and rotation
4. finish adding episode data to hotcan.json
5. convert remaining mp3's to ogg
6. find cdn to host audio files
7. add xml for feed to current project
